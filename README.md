Notebooks for the Data Mining projects, using Spotify datasets given to us by the professors. Tasks performed: data preprocessing, clustering, classification, regression, time series clustering and classification, dimensionality reduction, rebalancing.

"datasets" contains the datasets for DM1 (tabular balanced data).
"dataset" contains the files for DM2 (time series and tabular inbalanced data).

A file is missing (dist_mat_paa.npy) because it is too large for uploading (it contains the distance between time series after the PAA approximation).
